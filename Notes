1. Sleep disorder is not equal to insomnia. 
We have to create a target variable for insomnia using sleep disorder, sleep quality, and sleep duration.

2. There are a lot of categorical features, some with string values while others are numerical. 
Have to preprocess these before visualizing.

3. Create BMI feature with height and weight?

4. Try XGBoost Classifier + SHAP, PCA. There are too many features. 

5. Identify strongly correlated variables and use the most imp one. Use XGBoost. XGBoost is non-linear.

6. Sleep quality, although categorical, is a categorical feature.
