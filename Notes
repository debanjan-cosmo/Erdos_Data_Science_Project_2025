1. Sleep disorder is not equal to insomnia. 
We have to create a target variable for insomnia using sleep disorder, sleep quality, and sleep duration.

2. There are a lot of categorical features, some with string values while others are numerical. 
Have to preprocess these before visualizing.

3. Create BMI feature with height and weight?

4. Try XGBoost Classifier + SHAP, PCA. There are too many features. 

5. Identify strongly correlated variables and use the most imp one. Use XGBoost. XGBoost is non-linear.

6. Sleep quality, although categorical, is a categorical feature.

7. Check the naive baseline accuracy (i.e., the distribution of the target variable)

8. While splitting the data, try to preserve the class imbalance.


Approach to project:

1. Since the target for insomnia doesn't exist: create it.

    - From a medical research perspective, insomnia is not just about short sleep duration; it is a sleep disorder characterized by difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up too early, along with daytime impairment such as fatigue, mood disturbances, or reduced cognitive function.

Clinical Criteria for Insomnia (Based on Research & Sleep Medicine Guidelines)

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) and ICSD-3 (International Classification of Sleep Disorders) define insomnia disorder as:

	1.	Difficulty initiating sleep (taking more than 30 minutes to fall asleep).
	2.	Difficulty maintaining sleep (frequent awakenings, or being awake more than 30 minutes after falling asleep).
	3.	Early morning awakenings (waking up more than 30 minutes before desired wake time).
	4.	Daytime impairment (fatigue, difficulty concentrating, or excessive sleepiness).
	5.	Occurs at least 3 nights per week for at least 3 months (chronic insomnia).


Feature	Relevance to Insomnia:

- Sleep disorder (Y/N)	Captures reported sleep issues, though not specific to insomnia. So cannot use it as a reliable 1st filter for insomnia.
- Sleep duration	Less than 6 hours is considered insufficient sleep.
- Sleep quality (1-5)	1-2 = Poor quality, indicating difficulty staying asleep.
- Wake up during night (Y/N)	Frequent awakenings indicate sleep maintenance insomnia.
- Feel sleepy during day (Y/N)	Daytime impairment is a core diagnostic feature of insomnia.

Proposed Insomnia Labeling Rule for our Dataset:

We define insomnia = 1 if the person has at least 3 of the 5 conditions are met:

	1.	Sleep disorder = “Y”
	2.	Sleep duration < 6 hours
	3.	Sleep quality ≤ 2
	4.	Wake up during night = “Y”
	5.	Feel sleepy during day = “Y”

Otherwise, insomnia = 0

Why This Definition?

✅ Clinically grounded – based on recognized insomnia criteria (short sleep, poor quality, awakenings, and daytime impairment).
✅ Avoids over-diagnosis – not everyone with short sleep has insomnia.
✅ Ensures specificity – only those meeting multiple conditions are labeled.

Modeling Approach:

- Binary classification can be done to:
  a. Predict DED from other features, using the ones used to define insomnia
  b. Predict insomnia using the other features and DED.

Not sure whether this is needed.

Joint Approaches:

 	•	Multivariate Classification: We could treat both insomnia and DED as multi-class targets or multi-label classification, where we’re predicting both conditions at once. This would directly model the joint relationship without first separating it into individual binary problems.
	•	Causal Inference: Can be used to understand how one condition (e.g., insomnia) influences the other (e.g., DED), adjusting for other features. Can explore methods like propensity score matching, instrumental variable analysis, or structural equation modeling (SEM). This approach doesn’t require the binary classification steps, but it does require a clear understanding of how each feature might affect both conditions and how to control for confounding factors.
	•	Unsupervised Learning: To identify natural clusters of patients with similar characteristics (for example, groups with both DED and insomnia, or groups with other combinations of the conditions), unsupervised learning like k-means clustering or hierarchical clustering could be a done. This would not rely on predicting outcomes but rather on finding patterns or structures in the data. I think this is important for the project since we're trying to study the interdependencies between DED and insomnia. While doing this, drop the targets and use them for post analysis.

What’s the Best Accuracy You Can Get?

You can estimate it with:

a) Learning Curves

Plot training and cross-validation accuracy for increasing sizes of training data. If both are low → underfitting; if training high & val low → overfitting.

b) Model Stacking / Ensembling

Try ensemble methods (stacking, voting classifiers) and see if combining models improves performance.

c) Upper Bound Estimation

Try a powerful model like XGBoost, CatBoost, or even a neural net. If they all cap out around the same accuracy (~0.68–0.72), the problem might be:

	•	Data quality or feature set isn’t rich enough
	•	Feature engineering needs to improve
	•	Classes are overlapping too much

You can also do permutation-based feature importance to see which features actually contribute.
